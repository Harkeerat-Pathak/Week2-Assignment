Existing literature has found that obesity is a risk factor because it can increase estrogen levels in women. Specifically, a biomarker of estrogen level, serum estradiol, is an identified risk factor for breast cancer. To evaluate this type of relationship, researchers studied a group of 211 women of premenonausal age in the USA, 151 of whom were black (African American) and 60 white (Caucasian). Adiposity was quantified with two different measures: BMI and WHR. Estradiol level was also measured from hormone analysis. Other risk factors such as number of children and age of the woman are also included. The dataset includes the following descriptors:\n","\n","* **Id:** identifier.\n","* **Estrad (serum estradiol):** measure of estradiol (hormone analysis)\n","* **Ethnic (ethnicity):** African American or Caucasian.\n","* **Entage:** age of the person.\n","* **NumChild:** number of children.\n","* **Agefbo:** age at which the person has had the first child.\n","* **Anykids:** 1 if he/she has had children, 0 if he/she has not.\n","* **Agemenar:** age of menarche (first menstruation).\n","* **BMI:** measure of general adiposity.\n","* **WHR:** measure of abdominal adiposity.\n","* **Area:** rural (1) or urban (0)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XUcO8j-I21_e"},"source":["## File upload\n","\n","We start by loading the dataset we will be working with.
